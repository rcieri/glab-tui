# glab-tui

A terminal user interface (TUI) for GitLab and GitHub, built on top of [`glab`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli) and [`gh`](https://cli.github.com/). Browse issues, pull requests / merge requests, pipelines, runners, and releases without leaving your terminal.

---

## Features

- **GitHub & GitLab Dual Support** — Automatic detection of repository host, dynamically translating TUI actions and metadata updates to `gh` or `glab` CLI commands.
- **Issues** — list, filter, create, and edit issues (title, labels, assignees, milestone, due date, weight, confidentiality, description)
- **Merge Requests / Pull Requests** — list, filter, create MRs from issues, approve, merge, view diffs in terminal with code reviews, and edit MR/PR metadata
- **Code Reviews** — draft inline comments, multi-line selections, code suggestions with syntax highlighting, and atomic review submission
- **Side-by-Side Diff** — toggle between unified and side-by-side diff layouts with syntax highlighting
- **Pipelines / Actions** — inspect pipelines and their jobs, retry/cancel pipelines/actions and individual jobs, stream build traces
- **Runners** — list runners with structured details panel; pause/resume, edit descriptions, and monitor live performance/queue metrics
- **Releases** — browse project releases and view details in the terminal
- **Multi-colored Labels** — table columns render labels with their individual unique hashed colors, preserving search highlights
- **Columns Config Modal** — press `Tab` / `,` to open a centered popup overlay to toggle column visibility, group by any column, and set sort order
- **Value-based Column Filtering** — filter table rows by specific column values from the configure popup
- **Live Search** — fuzzy-filter across all visible columns by pressing `/`
- **Inline editing** — full edit menus with searchable multi-select selectors for labels, assignees, reviewers, and milestones
- **Interactive Date Picker** — calendar widget for Due Date / Start Date fields in edit menus
- **External editor** — descriptions and freeform fields open in your `$EDITOR` / `$VISUAL` (also via `Ctrl+E`)
- **Lazy-load tabs** — data for each tab is only fetched the first time you switch to it; refresh with `F5` / `Ctrl+R`
- **Themes** — six built-in color themes; fully customizable via `config.toml` or custom `.toml` files
- **Configurable keybindings** — every action is remappable in `~/.config/glab-tui/config.toml`

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Rust** (stable, edition 2024) | Install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) |
| **[`glab`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli)** | Must be on `$PATH` and authenticated (`glab auth login`) |
| **`git`** | Used to auto-detect the current project from `git remote get-url origin` |
| **A terminal emulator** | Any terminal that supports 256 colours and Unicode |

> **Windows note:** the binary works on Windows. Editor integration uses `cmd /c` automatically when `$OS` is Windows.

---

## Installation

### From source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rcieri/glab-tui
cd glab-tui
cargo build --release
# The binary is at ./target/release/glab-tui
```

Copy the binary somewhere on your `$PATH`, e.g.:

```sh
cp target/release/glab-tui ~/.local/bin/
```

### With `cargo install` (from the repo root)

```sh
cargo install --path .
```

### Install script (Linux / macOS)

```sh
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rcieri/glab-tui/main/install.sh | sh
```

Or with `wget`:

```sh
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rcieri/glab-tui/main/install.sh | sh
```

The binary is installed to `~/.local/bin/` (configurable via `PREFIX` environment variable).

### Install script (Windows)

```powershell
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rcieri/glab-tui/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

The binary is installed to `$env:USERPROFILE\.local\bin\` (configurable via `-Prefix` parameter).

---

## Configuration

### Authentication

`glab-tui` delegates all API calls to the `glab` and `gh` CLIs — authenticate once and you're done:

```sh
glab auth login   # for GitLab repos
gh auth login     # for GitHub repos
```

The active project is detected automatically from the `origin` remote in the current working directory.

### Config file

On first launch, `glab-tui` writes a default config to:

```
~/.config/glab-tui/config.toml          # Linux / macOS (XDG)
$GLAB_TUI_CONFIG                         # override: set to the full file path
```

The generated file is fully annotated. Key sections:

```toml
# Pick a built-in theme preset
theme_preset = "default"   # default | tokyo-night | gruvbox | nord | catppuccin-mocha | dracula

# Override individual colors (takes precedence over theme_preset)
# [theme]
# bg = "#121214"
# border_focused = "#31bf67"
# ...19 color tokens total

# Remap any keybinding
[keybindings.global]
next_tab = "l"
# ...

[keybindings.issues]
create_issue = "n"
edit_entity = "e"
# ...

# Persist default column visibility / grouping per pane
# [issues]
# columns = ["ID", "State", "Title", "Labels"]
# group_by_column = "State"
```

### Custom themes

Drop any `<name>.toml` file into `~/.config/glab-tui/themes/` and set `theme_preset = "<name>"` in `config.toml`. The file must define the same 19 color tokens as the bundled themes.

### Editor

Set `$EDITOR` or `$VISUAL` to control which editor opens for description and freeform fields:

```sh
export EDITOR=nvim   # or vim, nano, hx, code, etc.
```

The default fallback is `helix` (`hx`). Inside any edit menu you can also press `Ctrl+E` to open the editor directly.

---

## Usage

```sh
# Run from inside a GitLab or GitHub repository:
cd /path/to/your/repo
glab-tui

# Specifying optional flags:
glab-tui --repo organization/project-name
glab-tui --dir /path/to/other/repo
```

### Options

| Flag | Argument | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--repo` | `owner/repo` | Launch glab-tui for a custom remote repository |
| `--dir` | `/path/to/dir` | Launch glab-tui in a custom repository directory |
| `-h`, `--help` | | Print usage help details |

The TUI will launch in the terminal, auto-detecting the project context and fetching the Issues tab immediately.
